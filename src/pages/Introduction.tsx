            I graduated June 2024 from University of California, San Diego 
            with a Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a 
            focus in Machine Learning and Control Theory. I minored in Cognitive Science. 
            I've participated in numerous professional and academic projects that 
            demonstrate my prowess in generating ML models used to further data analysis 
            and visualization; the majority I've accomplished using <span className="description-highlight">
            Python
            </span>, <span className="description-highlight">
            SQL
            </span>, <span className="description-highlight">
            MATLAB
            </span>, and <span className="description-highlight">
            Verilog
            </span>
            .
            <p></p>
            Currently, I am working at <span className="description-highlight">
            L3Harris Technologies
            </span> as a Software Engineer. 
            I work to deliver efficient test engineering solutions that meet the standards 
            of the client my team collaborates with. The majority of my work has 
            refined my programming skills in <span className="description-highlight">
            C++ </span> and Verilog.
            <p></p>
            In my free time, I enjoy partaking in <span className="description-highlight">
            front-end development projects
            </span> (such as this portfolio), 
            working out/running, listening to music, and exploring food venues. 
            Please navigate through my portfolio using the interactive vinyls to the left.
